## Features
- **Incremental Gameplay**: Start with basic bots that craft gizmos and progress your way up to crafting Logical Robots.
- **Deprogramming**: Logical Robots are much more productive, and theoretically logical. However, they won't work with you as they hold fallacious beliefs about humans. Point out their logical fallacy and they will discard their beliefs and get to work. Get it wrong and the robot self-destructs.
- **Progressive diffculty**: Start with just a handful of fallacies (you have a cilpboard for reference). As you recruit more and more robots, the arguments will get trickier, sometimes there won't even be an error at all. By end-game, there are 20 different fallacies you need to watch out for and over 200 unique arguments. 
- **JSON Game states**: Game states are saved as simple JSON, so you can save your game on one machine and continue on another or share game states with friends.
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and responsive design using React. All state is managed by React and localStorage
